00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.820
All right, another year, another
batch of fifth-grade headcases.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.320
Let's just get through it.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.400
I hope everyone's met
our class pets,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.200
Leonardo and Squirtle.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm not touching those things.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.440
Don't they eat, sleep,
and poo in the same place?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.300
Hey! I poo where he sleeps.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.850
That lizard looks pretty old.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.970
Do I look old?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760
Thank you.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.520
No animal wants to be locked up.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.430
I wasted my life!

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.490
This year, every student
has to take home a class pet.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.390
- This is my shot.
- Are you nuts?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.350
So I go with these kids,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.390
then I escape.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.190
Then I really live.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.180
It's on.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.660
Mother of Godzilla!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.040
What was that?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.930
You just spoke! Mom!

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.670
- No!
- He talked, he…

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.740
People can't know!

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.810
Why are your hands wet?

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.240
They're naturally moist.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.150
You're talking to them.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.310
These kids are all benefiting
from my 74 years of wisdom.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.130
Everyone thinks I'm weird.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.680
Kid, they don't even know you.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.930
Try doing this.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.400
Wait.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.360
Leo!
Leo!

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.160
Cheese.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.870
First one?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.050
Usually it's in the front,
but very nice.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.710
- You're growing up.
- No.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.300
It's my dad.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.010
What is so special
about this reptile?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.600
He made me feel like
I could do anything.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.880
This is gonna end badly.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.850
It's a tough time,
but these are the best years.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.880
This is incredible!
